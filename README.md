# Predict-The-Salary-Machine-Learning-Project
You are given a 30 years of data consisting of one independent variable named 'Years Of Experience'. The target variable is 'Salary'.
This can be made by Linear Regrassion. So I did it by three ways:
A) Firstly I did it by simple Linear Regrassion with out transformation.
B) Secondly I did it by Linear Regrassion with transformation.
C) Lastly, I did it by Polynomial Features
After doing all of these, I came across a conclusion that Linear Regrassion with Polynomial Features with degree 2 gives the best accuracy.
